Lesson 5
---except_exercise.py---
A silly little program that calls functions from except_test.py
several of which lead to exceptions which must be handled within
the except_exercise.py script, not the except_text.py script.



---mailroom_3.py---
Mailroom part 3 assignment.  Same as part 2 but utilizes exception
handling and list comprehension to simplify the code.  Also uses
built-in functions to sort in a simpler manner than was done in part
2.
